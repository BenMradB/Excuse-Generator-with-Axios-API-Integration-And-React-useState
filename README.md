# React-Excuse-Generator-with-Axios-API-Integration-And-React-useState
This is a React app that generates excuses for different scenarios such as family, party, and office. The app uses Axios to fetch data from a backend API hosted on Vercel. The API endpoint used is defined in the baseURL constant. The app also imports an Excuse component that is used to display the generated excuse.
